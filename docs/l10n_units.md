## L10N Units of measure

Units of measures are also different in serveral countries. While most countries use the metric system, there are 
countries using other units.

Django-l10n-extensions have unit localization for the following measures:
1. Distance (meters, yards, km, miles, etc.)
2. Mass (gram, pound, tonnes, short tons, etc.)
3. Area (square meter, square foot, hectare, acre, etc.)
4. Volume (liter, gallon, cubic dm, cubic gallon, etc.)
5. Temperature (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin)
6. Speed (meter/sec., km/hour, miles/hour)
7. Precipitation (millimeter, inches)


__NOTE__:
The `Measure`-classes  are inspired on the `django.contrib.gis.measure` package.
