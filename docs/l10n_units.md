## L10N Units of measure

Units of measures are also different in serveral countries. While most countries use the metric system, there are 
countries using other units.

Django-l10n-extensions have unit localization for the following measures:
1. Distance (meters, yards, km, miles, etc.)
2. Mass (gram, pound, tonnes, short tons, etc.)
3. Volume (liter, gallon, milliliter, )
4. Area
5. Temperature
6. Speed
7. Precipitation


__NOTE__:
The `Measure`-classes  are inspired on the `django.contrib.gis.measure` package.
